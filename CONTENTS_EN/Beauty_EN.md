# Trends 2025: Stylish Hairstyles, Hair Care, and Solutions

## ✂️ **Main Haircut Trends**

1. **French Bob 2.0**  
   A modern version of a classic: length to the chin, soft layers, and an asymmetrical parting. Suitable for all types of hair and face shapes, it especially emphasizes cheekbones. Stylists recommend combining it with a curtain bang for a "Parisian chic" look.
   *Example:* Lily Collins and Daisy Edgar-Jones.

2. **Long Hair with Face-Framing Layers**  
   After years of dominance by short cuts, luxurious long hair with soft layers framing the face is making a comeback. The focus is on health and natural texture — perfect for both curly and straight hair.

3. **Shag with Modern Layers**  
   An updated version of the 70s cut: smoother transitions and more volume at the roots. Ideal for fine hair, adding texture and movement. It’s easily styled with a blow dryer or air-dried.

4. **Ultra-Short Bob and Pixie**  
   Bold cuts in the spirit of Emma Stone: asymmetrical lines, textured strands, and emphasis on the nape area. Requires frequent visits to the stylist but perfectly highlights facial features.

5. **Wolf Cut and Bixie**  
   A mix of bob and shag with ragged ends. Creates a "just woke up" effect — voluminous crown, graduated layers. Perfect for experimenting with color.
